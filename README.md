# Train a ConvNext model with Flax/Jax

## Introduction
This is tutorial on how to build a state-of-the-art ConvNext using Flax. See [convnext_mnist.ipynb](../blob/master/convnext_mnist.ipynb) for a walkthrough of training a ConvNext.

*Code taken from [Getting started with Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html)*
 
 
**Note**: Due to limited usage, training on Colab could be timed out before training
